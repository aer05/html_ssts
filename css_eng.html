        <h2>CSS</h2>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and are used to style the HTML website, as the name suggests.
        CSS makes a structure for the content of the HTML document and gives it a desired appearance. 
        CSS can be used for styling everything from the background, colors, fonts, borders, formats and so on.

        <h2>History of CSS</h2>
        At the beginning of the age of internet, there were not many options for designing and styling the websites as developers imagined. 
        They could only determine the parts of the website's content (such as pictures or divisions of text), 
        but the browser then styled everything else on its own.
        <br>
        <br>
        Soon after, tags for styling the websites appeared. 
        They provided more control over how the site looked, but there was still a problem - 
        styling was very time consuming since each change had to be made on its own. Luckily to solve the problem, 
        style sheets were made, which allowed the developers to design the websites with ease.

        <h2>CSS versions</h2>
        October 1994, Håkon Wium sent his first suggestion of rules for CSS to the W3C organisation. 
        It has been accepted and Håkon released CSS with the help of a W3C member, Bert Bos. 
        CSS 1 became officially released on december 1996.
        <br>
        <br>
        CSS 2 was released on may 1998, but was completed later, in 2002.
        <br>
        CSS 3 started to develop sooner then the finished version of CSS 2 has been released; in 1999. 
        Unlike other versions, CSS 3 was devided on modules and is based on both previous versions.
        CSS 3 is currently the most recent version of CSS.
