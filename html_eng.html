        <h2>What is HTML</h2>
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. As the name suggests, 
        its a markup language used for making websites using tags and atributes. 
        It represents a base of a website. With the help it, 
        solely the actual contents of the site can be adjusted but the actual style of the site 
        is then adjusted with CSS - sheet style language. 
        HTML can be written in any text editor (even notepad).
        <br>
        <br>
        HTML elements are made of marks, written between a less then and a greater then sign ( &lt;element&gt; ). 
        HTML marks are written in pairs (eg.  &lt;element&gt; content &lt;/element&gt; ). 
        Content is written inside that pair of elements. 
        Other elements can also be put inside elements, which is called nesting of elements.
        <br>
        <br>
        Everyone has access to HTML codes of public websites through using the shortcut Ctrl+U.

        <h2>History of HTML and its versions</h2>
        In 1991,Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor of CERN, developed the very first version of HTML, 
        protocol HTTP and built the first server. 
        Soon after that (around 1993), it came to huge growth of the internet. 
        First browser for general use has been created at the time as well, named Mosaic. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In november 1995, IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) developed a new version of HTML, HTML 2.0.
        It contained all the elements from the previous version, but with few additional ones. 
        HTML 2.0 became a standard for website development until 1997.
        <br>
        <br>
        Version HTML 3.0 bought some problems. 
        Since more and more people became interested into website development, 
        there were more demands for new additional elements that were not supported by HTML at the time.
        A group led by Dave Raggett made the updated HTML version with the wanted elements, 
        but internet browsers at that time werent powerful enough to support the version. 
        This is why the version has never been officially enforced.
        But because the inability of browsers started representing a problem through time as well, 
        an organisation W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) presented a clean version of HTML in their first post, 
        in which they removed most elements of HTML 3.0, but added the most essential ones. 
        <br>
        With this, HTML 3.2 became an official standard for website developing until this day. 
        <br>
        <br>
        HTML 4.0 contained even more new elements, including support for CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), a sheet style language. 
        HTML 4.1 was the last classic version of HTML before first appearance of XML - 
        a software- and hardware-independent tool for storing and transporting data, with which HTML needed an update as well.

        <h2>XML and HTML</h2>
        XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language, and it's a simple markup language, much like HTML, but with a few differences:
         - XML doesnt have predefined tags like HTML does            
         - HTML was designed to display data
         - XML was designed to carry data
        <br>
        <br>
        XHTML 1 was an intermediate stage between HTML 4.0 and XML. 
        The version is compatible with HTML 4.0 and supports all the XML rules at the same time.
        <br>
        <br>
        After that, HTML 5 came. This is the current newest version of HTML.
        It's compatible with XHTML 1 and has bought a few new features, such as DOCTYPE 
        (defining the document type), more options for multimedia 
        (adding audio and video contents no longer required plugins) and some new tags.
