            <h2>How to make your own website</h2>
            There is multiple options for creating your own website, but they do depend on what will the site be used for.
            <br>
            For quicker and easier development and styling of the site, there is multiple websites for this purpose, 
            for example Wix.com, Website.com, Google Sites, etc.  
            However, the problem for most of them is that they don't really allow you to costumise them as much as u would be able to,
             if you developed a site through learning HTML and CSS. 
             There are usually additional options for costumisation, but those come at a price.
            <br>
            <br>
            So for more control over the site, a better option might be developing the website 
            through an integrated development enviroment (IDE) or even a simple Notepad. 
            It does take quite some more time to learn and get used to HTML and CSS properly, 
            but that is in some cases a more accessible and a very rewarding option.
            <br>
            Learning the language is easily accessible through multiple useful websites and youtube tutorials.
            <br>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            If you want to make your website public, you will need server hosting and a domain name.
            There is free options for the hosting (GitHub), but a custom domain name can only be obtained by a price, usually 10 to 20€.
            <br>
            Depending on what the website will be used for, the custom domain name is not necessary 
            since the site will work just fine with the one you get from the server hosting provider.
            <br>
            <br>
            More about the server hosting and domain names is explained in this video.
